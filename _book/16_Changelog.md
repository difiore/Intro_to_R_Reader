# Changelog

## Version 1.0.1
Released 2019-04-01 (no joke!)

* Added "State of the Book" disclaimer to the introduction, as changes are being made
* Changed references to "course" and "reader" to "book", reflecting new purpose of document
* Deleted 12: Machine Learning and 11: Specialized Applications, with intents to roll the relevant pieces into EDA and MCA
* Split chapter 1 into two (Introduction/Data Viz) due to length; this made every chapter number change
* Edits to chapter 1, chapter 2

## Version 1.0.0
This is the build I started tracking changes from, last updated 2019-01-24. At this point, the book had 12 chapters, as well as an FAQ and list of resources.
