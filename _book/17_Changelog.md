# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0
Released 2019-06-20

* Split chapter 3 into two (Workflow/Wrangling), because those are different topics and these aren't course notes anymore, so relatedness matters more than each unit being similar length. That said, I want the Workflow chapter to be longer or rolled into another unit, so we'll see how that lasts.
* Restructured chapters on Wrangling, EDA, and "More Complex Analyses" to now more tighly match the data analysis pipeline model - now form the Wrangling-EDA-Model chapters.
* Reordered chapters - stats to the end as a glossary, and others shifted to make room for the pipeline model in the middle.
* Edits to chapter 3 (Workflow). This chapter is such a nub, I want to roll it into something else - but it shouldn't be earlier and doesn't make sense to be later, so.
* Edits to chapter 4 (Wrangling), basically stealing all of chapter 3
* Edits to chapter 5 (EDA), calming it down somewhat
* Edits to chapter 6 (Modeling), which basically rewrote the thing
* Slowly changing some just bizarre markdown syntax I was using (three graves for in-line code, for instance)
* Added parts worth saving of cut chapters into chapter 6. I'm planning on retooling this entire chapter - making it an introduction to modeling concepts.
* Changed file names for pretty much every chapter; whoops.
* Introduced massive redundancy to 9; working on reducing for next build
* Moved myself to Boston and relocated most of my hours to my new company; book building is going slower

Goals for next incremental release:
- Fix typos and general bad flow through chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 - and establish how much stats I expect people to come to the table with; it needs to go to either "basic stats" or "none"
- Cleaning edits

Goals for next minor release:
- The above, AND
- Rewrite 9

## Version 1.0.1
Released 2019-04-01 (no joke!)

* Added "State of the Book" disclaimer to the introduction, as changes are being made
* Changed references to "course" and "reader" to "book", reflecting new purpose of document
* Deleted 12: Machine Learning and 11: Specialized Applications, with intents to roll the relevant pieces into EDA and MCA
* Split chapter 1 into two (Introduction/Data Viz) due to length; this made every chapter number change
* Edits to chapter 1, chapter 2

## Version 1.0.0
This is the build I started tracking changes from, last updated 2019-01-24. At this point, the book had 12 chapters, as well as an FAQ and list of resources.
